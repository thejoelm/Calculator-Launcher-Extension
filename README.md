# Calculator-Launcher-Extension

I made this personal project in order to help with ease of access and use in accessing different types of calculators when doing math-related work. This project helped to improve my knowledge of JavaScript as well as how to use different images in CSS and integration into HTML. 

# How to Use

To use, create a new folder to store the files provided, then download the files and put them into the folder created. Open Developer Mode in chrome extensions, and load the folder into the extensions. 
To use the extension, open the extension and click on whichever calculator is needed. There are currently only two calculators, but more may be added. 

The first calculator is a basic calculator, used for basic math functions such as addition and multiplication. The calculator can be found at www.calculator.net
The second calculator is a scientific and graphical calculator that can be used for more intensive mathematical problems, as well as graphing problems. This calculator can be found at www.desmos.com/calculator
